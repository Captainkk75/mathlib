# `move_add`: a tactic for moving summands

Calling `move_add [a, ← b, c]`, recursively looks inside the goal for expressions involving a sum.
Whenever it finds one, it moves the summands that unify to `a, b, c`, removing all parentheses.

See the doc-string for `tactic.interactive.move_add` for more information.

##  Implementation notes

The implementation of `move_add` only moves the terms specified by the user (and rearranges
parentheses).

An earlier version of this tactic also had a relation on `expr` that performed a sorting on the
terms that were not specified by the user.  This is very easy to implement, if desired, but is not
part of this tactic.  We had used the order given by the `≤` on `string` and a small support for
sorting `monomial`s by increasing degree.

Note that the tactic `abel` already implements a very solid heuristic for normalizing terms in an
additive commutative semigroup and produces expressions in more or less standard form.
The scope of `move_add` is different: it is designed to make it easy to move individual terms
around a sum.

##  Future work

* Add support for `neg` in additive groups?
* Add different operations other than `+`, most notably `*`?
* Add functionality for moving terms across the two sides of an in/dis/equality.
  E.g. it might be desirable to have `to_lhs [a]` converting `b + c = a + d` to `- a + b + c = d`.
* Add a non-recursive version for use in `conv` mode.
* Revise tests?

/--  Given a list `lp` of `bool × pexpr` and a list `sl` of `expr`, scan the elements of `lp` one
at a time and produce 3 sublists of `sl`.

If `(tf,pe)` is the first element of `lp`, we look for the first element of `sl` that unifies with
`pe.to_expr`.  If no such element exists, then we discard `(tf,pe)` and move along.
If `eu ∈ sl` is the first element of `sl` that unifies with `pe.to_expr`, then we add `eu` as the
next element of either the first or the second list, depending on the boolean `tf` and we remove
`eu` from the list `sl`.  In this case, we continue our scanning with the next element of `lp`,
replacing `sl` by `sl.erase eu`.

Once we exhaust the elements of `lp`, we return the three lists:
* first the list of elements of `sl` that came from an element of `lp` whose boolean was `tt`,
* next the list of elements of `sl` that came from an element of `lp` whose boolean was `ff`, and
* finally the ununified elements of `sl`.

The ununified elements of `sl` get used for error management: they keep track of which user inputs
are superfluous. -/

Calling `move_add [a, ← b, c]`, recursively looks inside the goal for expressions involving a sum.
Whenever it finds one, it moves the summands that unify to `a, b, c`, removing all parentheses.
Repetitions are allowed, and are processed following the user-specified ordering.
The terms preceded by a `←` get placed to the left, the ones without the arrow get placed to the
right.  Unnamed terms stay in place.  Due to re-parenthesizing, doing `move_add` with no argument
may change the goal. Also, the *order* in which the terms are provided matters: the tactic reads
them from left to right.  This is especially important if there are multiple matches for the typed
terms in the given expressions.

A single call of `move_add` moves terms across different sums in the same expression.
Here is an example.

```lean
import tactic.move_add

example {a b c d : ℕ} (h : c = d) : c + b + a = b + a + d :=
begin
  move_add [← a, b],  -- Goal: `a + c + b = a + d + b`  -- both sides changed
  congr,
  exact h
end

example {a b c d : ℕ} (h : c = d) : c + b * c + a * c = a * d + d + b * d :=
begin
  move_add [_ * c, ← _ * c], -- Goal: `a * c + c + b * c = a * d + d + b * d`
  -- the first `_ * c` unifies with `b * c` and moves it to the right
  -- the second `_ * c` unifies with `a * c` and moves it to the left
  congr;
  assumption
end
```

The list of expressions that `move_add` takes is optional and a single expression can be passed
without brackets.  Thus `move_add ← f` and `move_add [← f]` mean the same.

Finally, `move_add` can also target one or more hypotheses.  If `hp₁, hp₂` are in the
local context, then `move_add [f, ← g] at hp₁ hp₂` performs the rearranging at `hp₁` and `hp₂`.
As usual, passing `⊢` refers to acting on the goal as well.

##  Reporting sub-optimal usage

The tactic could fail to prove the reordering, though I would not know what the cause of this could
be.  Still, there are three kinds of unwanted use for `move_add`: the tactic does not fail in these
cases, but flags the unwanted use.
1. `move_add [vars]? at *` reports gloally unused variables and whether *all* goals
   are unchanged, not *each unchanged goal*.
2. If a target of `move_add` is left unchanged by the tactic, then this will be flagged (unless
   we are using `at *`).
3. If a user-provided expression never unifies, then the variable is flagged.

The tactic does not produce an error, but reports unused inputs and unchanged targets.

For instance, `move_add ← _` always reports an unchanged goal, but never an unused variable.

##  Comparison with existing tactics

* `tactive.interactive.abel`
  performs a "reduction to normal form" that allows it to close goals involving sums with higher
  success rate than `move_add`.  If the goal is an equality of two sums that are simply obtained by
  reparenthesizing and permuting summands, then `move_add [appropriate terms]` can close the goal.
  Compared to `abel`, `move_add` has the advantage of allowing the user to specify the beginning and
  the end of the final sum, so that from there the user can continue with the proof.

* `tactic.interactive.ac_change`
  supports a wide variety of operations.  At the moment, `move_add` only works with addition.
  Still, on several experiments, `move_add` had a much quicker performance than `ac_change`.
  Also, for `move_add` the user need only specify a few terms: the tactic itself takes care of
  producing the full rearrangement and proving it "behind the scenes".

###  Remark:
It is still possible that the same output of `move_add [exprs]` can be achieved by a proper sublist
of `[exprs]`, even if the tactic does not flag anything.  For instance, giving the full re-ordering
of the expressions in the target that we want to achieve will not complain that there are unused
variables, since all the user-provided variables have been matched.  Of course, specifying the order
of all-but-the-last variable suffices to determine the permutation.  E.g., with a goal of
`a + b = 0`, applying either one of `move_add [b,a]`, or `move_add a`, or `move_add ← b` has the
same effect and changes the goal to `b + a = 0`.  These are all valid uses of `move_add`.
