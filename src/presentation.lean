/-! ### Topologies through typeclasses -/

/- Typeclasses are a device to register some kinds of structures on some types. The types are
unbundled, but the system has a way to look automatically for these structures, so that no input
is needed from the user.

cf. typeclasses in Isabelle/HOL, typeclasses or canonical classes in coq

#print continuous
/- structure continuous : Œ† {Œ± : Type u_1} {Œ≤ : Type u_2} [topological_space Œ±]
  [topological_space Œ≤], (Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤) ‚Üí Prop
the fields between square brackets [topological_space Œ±] and [topological_space Œ≤] are filled
automatically by the system
-/

/- We can check that the system knows how to find a topology by the command `by apply_instance`,
which means: please, Lean, fetch my an instance of what I am asking for. -/
def foo : topological_space ‚Ñù := by apply_instance

/- Checking which instance has been found by Lean is not that instructive: -/
#print foo

/-
@[instance, priority 100, reducible]
def uniform_space.to_topological_space : Œ† {Œ± : Type u} [uniform_space Œ±], topological_space Œ±

This means that Lean has found a uniform_space instance on ‚Ñù, and deduced a topological_space
instance from it. The uniform space instance is again found by instance search. There is a
(possibly complicated) recursion going on here.

Ensured by linters that check the whole library at every PR.

-/

/-! ### Type synonyms -/

/- Sometimes, one wants to put several topologies on a single type.

Example: the dual of a normed real vector space has:
* the norm topology
* the weak-* topology

If one registers two different topologies on the same type, instance search will find randomly
one or the other.

Solution: type synonyms. Instance search does not unfold the types unless a specific attribute is
set, so it won't get confused

### Polish spaces

99% of the time, the maths fit well with the picture "one type / one natural topology".
1% of the time, it gets messy

namespace fake_copy

/-- A Polish space is a topological space with second countable topology, that can be endowed
with a metric for which it is complete.
We register an instance from complete second countable metric space to polish space, and not the
other way around as this is the most common use case.

To endow a Polish space with a complete metric space structure, use
```
letI : metric_space Œ± := polish_space_metric Œ±,
haveI : complete_space Œ± := complete_polish_space_metric Œ±,
haveI : second_countable_topology Œ± := polish_space.second_countable Œ±,
```

  complete := ‚ü®m, rfl, h'‚ü© }

/-- A set in a topological space is clopenable if there exists a finer Polish topology for which
this set is open and closed. It turns out that this notion is equivalent to being Borel-measurable,
