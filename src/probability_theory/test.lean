Right now, pdf is defined such that `μ.with_density f` must agree with
`map X ℙ` everywhere, while in introductory probability courses, is condition
is often relaxed such that they only need to agree on intervals of the form `(-∞, x]`.
While, these conditions are not equivalent in general, for finite measures, it is the case.

pf. Use Dykin's π-λ theorem.

With that in mind, we can show that if `F(x) := map X ℙ (-∞, x]` is differentiable,
by FTC `f := F'` satisfies `∫ x in a..b, f x ∂μ = F b - F a = map X ℙ (a, b]`, hence, implying
`μ.with_density f` equals `map X ℙ` and thus, `f =ᵐ[μ] pdf X`.

This allows us to use traditional methods for find the pdf of transformations, namely
`pdf g(X) x = pdf X (g⁻¹ x) * g'`.
