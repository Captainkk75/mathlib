/-! # Typeclass for graded ring
For definition of a ring `R` being graded by `A : ι → add_subgroup R`, see doc string of
`graded_ring`.

- `graded_ring.decompose : R → ⨁ i, A i` and `graded_ring.recompose : ⨁ i, A i → R` are the ring
isomorphism between `R` and `⨁ i, A i` if `R` is graded by `A`.
- `graded_ring.complete_lattice.independent` states that the `A` is independent in the sense that
for any `i : ι`, `A i` and `⨆ (j ≠ i), A j` intersect trivially. The most noticable consequence of
this is that `A i` and `A j` intersects trivally for distinct `i` and `j`.
- `graded_ring.proj R A i r` is the degree `i : ι` component of `r : R`.
- `graded_ring.support R A r` is the `finset ι` containing the `i : ι` such that the degree `i`
component of `r` is not zero.
- `is_homogeneous R A x` states that `x ∈ A i` for some `i : ι`.
- `homogeneous_element R A` is the subtype of `R` of all `x` such that `is_homogeneous R A x`.
- `mv_polynomial_is_graded` provides an instance saying that `mv_polynomial R σ` is ring graded by
its homogeneous components.

/-- A graded ring is a `ring R` such that `R` can be decomposed into a collection of
  `add_subgroups R` indexed by `ι` such that the connonical map `R → ⨁ i, A i` is a bijective map
  respecting multiplication, i.e. product of an element of degree `i` and an element of degree `j`
  is an element of degree `i + j`.
