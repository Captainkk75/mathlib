# Joint and marginal distributions

This file defines joint and marginal distributions on random variables.

Given an event space `α`, an arbitrary (not necessarily countable) index type `ι`, 
an index of types `β : ι → Type*` each with their own measurable space, an index
of random variables `f : Π (i : ι), α → (β i)` and a measure `μ : measure α`,
we define the joint distribution `joint μ f` as the distribution on `Π (i : ι), β i`
induced by `f` via `μ`.

For a set of "marginalizing variable" indices `mv : set ι`, we define the
marginal distribution `marginal μ f mv` as the distribution on `Π (i : mv), β i` induced by
the restriction of `f` to `mv` via `μ`.

We also define a generic marginalization on a measure `μ : measure (Π (i : ι), β i)` to
an index subset `mv` (yielding a `measure (Π (i : mv), β i)`) as `marginalize μ mv`.

## Notations

Because we expect to frequently use `set.pi_restrict` in this context, we define special notation
for it. For a `S : set ι`,
* the notation `<[S]` stands for `set.image (set.pi_restrict S)`,
  i.e. the restrictor of `set (Π (i : ι), β i)` to `set (Π (i : S), β i)`, and
* the notation `>[S]` stands for `set.image (set.pi_restrict S)`,
  i.e. the extender of `set (Π (i : S), β i)` to `set (Π (i : ι), β i)`.
In both cases `S` can be omitted from the brackets to be inferred.

## Main statements

* `marginal_eq_marginalize_joint`: the marginal distribution is the marginalized joint distribution.
* `marginal_apply`: the marginal distribution's measure of a set `s : Π (i : mv), β i`
is the joint distribution's measure of that same set, extended to allow the unmarginalized variables
to take any value.
