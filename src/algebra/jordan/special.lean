# Special Jordan algebras

A commutative multiplication on a real or complex space can be constructed from any multiplication
by "symmetrisation" i.e
```
a∘b = 1/2(ab+ba).
```
When the original multiplication is associative, the symmetrised algebra is a commutative Jordan
algebra. A commutative Jordan algebra which can be constructed in this way from an associative
multiplication is said to be a special Jordan algebra.

## Main results

- `is_comm_jordan` : The symmeterised algebra arising from an associative algebra is a commutative
  Jordan algebra.
