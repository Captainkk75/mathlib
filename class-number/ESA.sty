\section{Introduction}
I am working on formalizing mathematics in an automated theorem prover called Lean.
The aim of my PhD is to formalize the statement of the Iwasawa Main Conjecture.
The statement somehow unifies an "algebraic side", coming from characteristic polynomials,
with an "analytic side", coming from p-adic L-functions. I have been working on formalizing
p-adic L-functions in Lean. This is still a work in progress, and will hopefully be complete
by August 2021. \\


A lot of tools are needed in order to construct the p-adic L-functions, including but not
restricted to: Bernoulli numbers and polynomials, locally compact Hausdorff totally
disconnected spaces, and the p-adic integers and its topological properties. \\

Lean has a mathematical library consisting of theorems, which can be used to prove
additional theory. This is a library maintained by the courtesy of several mathematicians and
computer scientists contributing daily. It is essential to remember that this is a communal effort,
and it would be impossible to construct such a vast library otherwise.

\section{Body}
\subsection{Bernoulli polynomials}
The Bernoulli polynomials are an important number theoretic object. They occur as special values
of the Reimann-zeta functions / p-adic L-functions. They are a generalization of
Bernoulli numbers. \\

The Bernoulli numbers $B_n$ are generating functions given by :
$$\sum B_n\frac{t^n}{n!}=\frac{t}{e^{t} - 1}$$

Note that several authors think of Bernoulli numbers $B_n'$ to be defined as :
$$\sum B_n'\frac{t^n}{n!}=\frac{t}{1-e^{-t}}$$

The difference between these two is : $B_n' = (-1)^n * B_n$, with $B_1 = \frac{-1}{2}$.
Thus, we define $B_n$ : \\
\lean{bernoulli' n = 1 - ∑ k : fin n, n.choose k / (n - k + 1) * bernoulli' k } \\
and $B_n'$ as : \\
\begin{lstlisting}
  def bernoulli (n : ℕ) : ℚ := (-1)^n * bernoulli' n
\end{lstlisting}
